# Compares the shortest path for a 2D maze search with AStar Algorithm vs. Reinforcement Learing
# Takes the size of the maze and number of obstacles as command line arguments
# Running in the scritpt from command line: pytthon maze_solver grid_size num_ostacles
# As an example, for a 20x20 grid with 30 obstacles, run python maze_solver 20 30
